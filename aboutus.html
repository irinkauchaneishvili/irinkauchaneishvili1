      		<p> On a very basic level, the phenomenon is quite simple to explain. It is created from a collision between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the atmosphere of the earth. </p>

			<p> The lights, which are also called aurora borealis, show up at night when the sky is dark. It’s like a <span class="bold">celestial ballet of light dancing across the night sky,</span> with a colour palette of green, blue, and sometimes even pink and violet.</p>	

			<p> But even though you can’t take the lights for granted – it is, after all, a natural phenomenon, just like the weather – you are still guaranteed to experience magical light in Northern Norway all through the polar night. On clear days, you can see beautiful sunset colours in the south while the sky to the north is a deep midnight blue. In “the blue hour” at twilight, the snowy landscape is bathed in a glassy, deep blue colour. And even if the Auroras don´t dance, <span class="bold"> experiencing the starry, limitless sky </span> can make you reconnect with the universe...</p>
